# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-28

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Monaco Text Macros" extension collects, uses, and shares your data. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) or user data to external servers.**

*   **Local Storage**: The extension uses your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) to save your custom macros and configuration settings. This data remains on your device and is not shared with the developer or any third parties.
*   **No Remote Code**: The extension does not use any remote code or analytics services.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions for the sole purpose of its functionality:

*   **`storage`**: Used to save your macro definitions and settings locally.
*   **`activeTab`**: Used to interact with the current tab only when you explicitly trigger the extension (e.g., toggling it on/off via keyboard shortcut).
*   **Host Permissions (`https://prism.openai.com/*`)**: The extension injects a content script into this specific website to provide macro expansion functionality within the editor. It does not read or transmit page content to any external server.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.
