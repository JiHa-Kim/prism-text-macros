Monaco Text Macros brings powerful, text-expansion capabilities to web-based Monaco editors, specifically optimized for OpenAI Prism and similar environments.

This project is inspired by the macros in the Obsidian LaTeX Suite plugin: https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite.

Do you miss the speed of your local editor when working in the browser? Monaco Text Macros bridges that gap by adding seamless, Obsidian-style macro expansion to your web workflow.

Key Features:

* Universal Text Macros: Define custom text replacements for frequent phrases, code blocks, or boilerplate. Type a short trigger, press Tab (or your configured key), and watch it expand instantly.
* Works with OpenAI Prism: Designed to integrate perfectly with the Prism editor environment, ensuring your workflow remains uninterrupted.
* LaTeX Math Support: Specialized snippets for technical writing. Type "mk" for inline math, "sq" for square roots, and more to drastically speed up scientific notation.
* Smart Expansion: The engine respects the editor's state, preserving syntax highlighting and undo history. It feels native, not like a hacky overlay.
* Obsidian Compatible: If you use Obsidian for note-taking, you'll feel right at home with the familiar snippet syntax and behavior.

How to Use:
1. Install: Add the extension to Chrome.
2. Navigate: Go to a supported site like prism.openai.com.
3. Type: Enter a trigger (e.g., ";hello" or "mk") and press the expansion key.
4. Configure: Click the extension icon to open the Options page, where you can add, remove, or customize your own macros.

Privacy & Security:
This extension operates entirely locally. It does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data, keystrokes, or code. Your macros are saved securely in your browser's local storage.
